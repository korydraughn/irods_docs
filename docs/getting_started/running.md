## Running the server

The easiest way to start an iRODS 5 server is by running the following command using the service account.

```bash
$ irodsServer -d
```

The server is launched as a daemon process and writes log messages to syslog.

iRODS 5 supports various launch options and is fully compatible with systemd. See the help text to learn more, i.e. `irodsServer -h`.
