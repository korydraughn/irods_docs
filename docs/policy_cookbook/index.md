# The iRODS Policy Cookbook

This section is all about presenting techniques to various policy-based situations encountered in the iRODS ecosystem.

Overtime, we hope this cookbook will grow and become a valuable resource for new and existing users of iRODS.

If you have suggestions on how to improve the cookbook or you've developed solutions that you feel could help others, please reach out to us by creating an issue at [https://github.com/irods/irods_docs](https://github.com/irods/irods_docs).
